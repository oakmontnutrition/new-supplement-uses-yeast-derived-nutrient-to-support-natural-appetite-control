# New Supplement Uses Yeast-Derived Nutrient to Support Natural Appetite Control
## Hunger Switch™ introduces a science-based approach to calorie reduction through the gut–brain axis — part of a growing trend toward nutritional appetite regulation.

**COLUMBUS, OH - October 17, 2025 -** A new functional supplement called Hunger Switch™ is drawing attention for using a naturally derived yeast peptide to help people manage appetite and calorie intake—without drugs or stimulants.

The formulation centers on **DNF-10®**, a clinically studied hydrolyzed yeast peptide shown to influence the gut–brain axis involved in hunger regulation. Researchers have found that participants using DNF-10® consumed significantly fewer calories per day, suggesting a potential new approach to appetite control through nutritional pathways rather than pharmacological ones.

By targeting the same biological communication loop that connects the digestive system and the brain’s satiety centers, [Hunger Switch™](https://oakmontnutrition.com/product/hunger-switch/) aims to support a more balanced relationship with food. The supplement pairs DNF-10® with complementary compounds including **L-theanine, caffeine**, and **inulin**—ingredients chosen to promote steady energy, reduce cravings, and support digestive health.

The product’s launch reflects a broader movement within the wellness industry toward **natural solutions that mimic the body’s existing metabolic cues.** As interest in GLP-1-based appetite therapies continues to rise, researchers and formulators are exploring nutritional compounds that can activate similar mechanisms through diet and supplementation.

Each batch of Hunger Switch™ is manufactured in the United States under current Good Manufacturing Practices (cGMP) and undergoes independent laboratory verification for purity and potency. The gummies are vegan-friendly and free from artificial dyes or preservatives.

Industry observers note that the growing focus on **gut–brain science** is shaping the next generation of weight-management and wellness products-offering consumers options that emphasize balance, sustainability, and accessible daily use.

DNF-10® is marketed by Fytexia.
